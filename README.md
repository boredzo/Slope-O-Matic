# Slope-O-Matic
## A simple angle-to-slope calculator for Mac

Using the knob or the text field, enter an angle in degrees. Slope-O-Matic will tell you the slope.

Notable angles:

- 0° (or any other multiple of 360) has a slope of 0. Or, intuitively: A flat line has no slope.
- 45° has a slope of 1.
- 90° (or any other multiple of 90° + 180°) has a slope of ∞. (Strictly speaking, this is undefined, but for the purpose I had in mind when I wrote this app, ∞ is the most useful value here.)
